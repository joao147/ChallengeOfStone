# ChallengeOfStone
I aplly to a work with elixir language, and the first filter is a programming challenge.

# Pseudorandom generetions
I did two functions to generete somo items and emails, you can change the maximum number of generete, 
just change this constants numberOfMaxGenereteItems and/or numberOfMaxGenereteEmails
I put as default 100 to both constants.

# How execute
1째 You need a package manager to node, like npm or yarn in your pc.
2째 So you'll use "npm i" or "yarn" to download dependencies.
3째 To execute, with npm use "npx ts-node ./challenge.ts", and with yarn "yarn ts-node ./challenge.ts".
4째 See the result.
